# Roadmap
INSIDE roadmap over technologies, their maturity and years.

Each item INSIDE considers corresponds to a GitHub issue. Each issue is then taggued according to:
- the topics it is about (ex : Semantics, Observation API, ...)
- its maturity having the Technology Readiness Level method in mind (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level). However, in an first attempt not all TRL Level are concerned. The following groupings are use "R&D" (TRL 1 -> ~ 4), "Maturation" (TRL ~ 5 -> ~ 7) and "Mature" (TRL ~ 8 -> 9).

Then GitHub projects have been set up to provide different Views on those issue
- Maturity view: https://github.com/INSIDE-information-systems/Roadmap/projects/1
- RoadMap - like Roadmap 2022 : https://github.com/INSIDE-information-systems/Roadmap/projects/4
